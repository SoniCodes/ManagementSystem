# ManagementSystem

This Java program allows users to create and manage a client database system. Users can input and store personal information of clients, such as their name, contact details, medical history, and any other relevant data. The program utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for efficient and scalable storage of client information.

• Who uses the software?

The software is used by medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, and/or administrative staff who need to efficiently manage client/patient information by using tasks or reports.
• What does the software do?

Its function is to create a database system for clients of healthcare facilities. It lets users input, save, view, and arrange clients’ details.
• Where and when will the software be used?

It will be used during office hours whenever medical professionals or administrators want to reach client data, reports, and tasks.
• How does the software work?

The program has a user-friendly interface where any medical personnel or administrator can insert customer’s data with their personal information and a brief history of their reports. The program comes integrated with MongoDB, a NoSQL database system that helps store and organize patients’ records effectively. By creating unique UUIDs for every task related to one particular client, users are able to locate/search for the clients easily. This search engine allows users to paste UUIDs or the patient name into it to help the files on their computers quickly.
• Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes?

It replaces manual or disparate systems and provides a centralized and organized solution for managing client data. It makes the client management process much more efficient. This accommodates growing databases and evolving needs through integration with MongoDB, thus scaling up. Workflow is made more efficient and accessible by such features as task management and UUID-based search. In general, the application simplifies patient care input for better administration efficiencies compared to traditional methods.
